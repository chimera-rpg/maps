Chamber of Origins:
  Name: Chamber of Origins
  Description: >
    The heart of where it all begins; where your journey begins.
  Lore: >
    It is said that the Great Originator was the one who set the world into motion. The one who believed the universe could be far more than collections of unformed energy. It is with this in mind that a spark was placed and that this spark, through untold iterators, became life. Once this life became self-directing, the Great Originator pulled the universe into full form and gave it direction.

    The Chamber of Origins was made directly by the Great Originator as a gift to life, one that allows life to be not only self-directing, but able to mediate its direction before it is even fully formed."
